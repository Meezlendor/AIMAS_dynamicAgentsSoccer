# AIMAS_dynamicAgentsSoccer

To install, this agent, you will only have to copy the code and paste it in one of the SoccerDroneAI_red/blue.cs file.

You will need pandas_bt to run it. Installation of pandas is explained in this video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHgxZA7ejDg&t=1s.

Once installed, you have to
+ drag and drop 3 agents on the main field and select the appropriate script SoccerDroneAI_red/blue.cs. Te agents can be foun in the prefab folder.
+ Add a pandas_bt component and link it to the Soccer.BT.txt tree file. Make sure to have the option "Manual" selected.

You will of course have to repeat the same process with your own agents : drag and drop them on the field and select their respective scripts.

In case you need picture, John's tutorial is pretty well illustrated : https://github.com/JohnMagnusson/DD2438VT201_Assignment_3_Group_6
